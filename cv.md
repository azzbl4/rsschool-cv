## About me

I started to get interested in programming when I was in school. We had an excellent teacher who taught Turbo Pascal, Basic, Fortran, Focal. After that I got my education in computer repair. But, life so happened, that I began to work in the construction of buildings. Now I want to continue learning programming, first in front-end development.
